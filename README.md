The purpose of this assignment was to take the previous version which looks almost identical but this time instead use a LinkedList. Linked list act as an array but are self contained within each other. You have to loop through each one to access the next one. You can't just jump ahead. Sorting them can be a hassle or a pain unless you dig pretty deep on the interweb.

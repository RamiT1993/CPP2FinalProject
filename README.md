# Hangman Game

Welcome to the Hangman Game! This program is a classic word guessing game with additional features such as sorting and displaying a list of possible words. The program maintains your wins and losses statistics using a linked list. The game uses base classes such as HangManBase to manage loading words from a JSON file and handling statistics, while the derived class HangManGame contains the main game logic and all of the games functionality, including user interactions and the game loop. A custom LinkedList template manages a linked list of words and their guessed status. This linked list also is constantly updating your game statistics as you play. You can also sort the list of words alphabetically or by length using the WordManager class which handles all the programs word related game logic.
